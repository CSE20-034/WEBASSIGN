           Brazilian cuisine varies greatly by region. This diversity reflects the country's history and mix of indigenous and immigrant cultures. This has created a national cooking style, marked by the preservation of regional differences. Since the imperial period the feijoada, a Portuguese stew with origins in Ancient Rome, has been the country's national dish. Luís da Câmara Cascudo wrote that, having been revised and adapted in each region of the country, it is no longer just a dish, but has become a complete food

             Crime Rate
         </h1>
         <h2> <img src=" https://cse20-034.github.io/WEBASSIGN/thief.jpg" class="food2" height="200px">First, do not let paranoia ruin your stay, but there are several steps you can do not to be an easy target (although there are still situations you cannot have fully under control). The biggest problem in Rio is petty theft such as pickpocketing - keep your valuables safe, it is advised to walk around only with the necessary amount of cash, also do not show off your electronics. Most of the crime is drug-related, so do not visit favelas (only on tour) and overall suburbs when driving, always check your GPS that it doesn't guide you through dangerous zones. We recommend you not to walk on the streets after dark, rather take Uber - that's what we did all the time here, and it paid off.

             Religion of Rio De Janeiro

            Brazil’s religious landscape is as diverse as it’s ethnic and geographic diversity. Accordingly, the majority of Brazilians in the country identify as Roman Catholic (64.4%), thus reflecting it’s historical relationship with Portugal and the Catholic Church. Of the remaining population, 22.2%.(
                Many Brazilians of colour consider it more advantageous to identify themselves as pardos and therefore do so. About one-third of Rio’s pardos are clearly mulattoes (mulatos; people of mixed African and European ancestry), while the vast majority of the city’s small preto population do not claim any known European ancestry. Cariocas are primarily Roman Catholic, although many simultaneously observe the practices of the Umbanda religion.

             Portuguese is the official and national language of Brazil[6] and is widely spoken by most of the population. The Brazilian Sign Language also has official status at the federal level. Aside from Portuguese, the country has also numerous minority languages, including indigenous languages, such as Nheengatu (a descendant of Tupi), and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants, such as Italian, German and Japanese. In some municipalities, those minor languages have official status: Nheengatu, for example, is an official language in São Gabriel da Cachoeira.

Some ecotourism is present in Brazil's Pantanal and the Amazon rainforest. In the Pantanal, there is the Araras Eco Lodge and the Jaguar Ecological Reserve. In the Amazon rainforest, an ecotourism project had been under consideration by Brazil's State Secretary for the Environment and Sustainable Development in 2009, along the Aripuanã river, in the Aripuanã Sustainable Development Reserve. Also, some community-based ecotourism exists in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve.

            Easy to miss but well worth seeking out, this artsy cultural hub is where cool kids come to mingle, dance and share ice cold bottles of beer. With an art gallery, outside terrace and regular themed music/arts nights,it combines a studiously informal hipster aesthetic with an impressive roster of DJ sets. This trendy spot is also known as the place for seriously good burgers - local food and drink magazines rate it as the best in town, and Comuna's customers tend to agree. Get here early in the evening if you want to sample them for yourself - after 11pm things get too packed for comfortable eating.
