<h1>Rio De Janerio’s statue of Christ the Redeemer</h1>

          <img src="https://ratisoaks.github.io/CSE20-034/TAJMAHAL.jpg" class="pigcha" width="400px" height="150px">  As it's statue was elected one of the world’s new seven wonders, Rio doesn’t lack natural beauty for postcards, but its most acclaimed feature is not only man-made, but was also elected one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007, alongside masterpieces like the famous Roman Colosseum  of Rome, Italy and the Taj Mahal of Uttar Pradesh, India. The 92-feet-wide arms statue had to be built over the precipices of Corcovado Mountain without room for scaffolding. Inaugurated in 1931, as a tribute to Rio’s 100th anniversary, the Christ is 98-feet-tall is also known as the largest Art Deco statue in the world. The statue was financed by Brazilians, designed by a Frenchmen, and built from Swedish stones. Despite the fact it is struck by lightning a couple times a year, it lives on strong, watching over the citizens of the Marvellous City, Rio De Janerio.

  <h1>Climate</h1>
    <h2><img src="https://ratisoaks.github.io/CSE20-034/https://ratisoaks.github.io/CSE20-034/weather.jpg" class="picture" width="400px" height="150px"> the region’s climate is generally tropical, hot, and humid, the climate of Greater Rio is strongly affected by its topography, its proximity to the ocean, and the shape of the Southern Cone of South America. Along the coast, the breeze, blowing alternately onshore and offshore, modifies the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached—especially during autumn and winter—by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, which cause frequent weather changes. But it is mostly in summer that strong showers may provoke catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.

        The City After Independence
    </h1>
    <h2>
        <img src="https://ratisoaks.github.io/CSE20-034/afterindep.jpg" class="pigcha" width="400px" height="160px">Expansion of coffee plantations in the state of Rio de Janeiro gave a new impulse to the city’s development. Nobles and bourgeois moved their residences north to the São Cristóvão district. Merchants and English bankers chose to live around the Outeiro da Glória and Praia do Flamengo areas in the south, or they established their residences in the nearby Botafogo and Laranjeiras districts. The French, on the other hand, lived in country houses scattered in the Tijuca area farther westward.

In addition, Rio’s service sector remains one of the strongest in the country, providing for increasing numbers of jobs in such areas as finance, communications, tourism and entertainment, public and private education, and computer engineering. Rio remains a major centre for cultural exhibitions and international conferences, and many of the more affluent and influential Brazilians keep homes there. Despite desperate conditions in the city’s favelas, as well as high rates of violent crime throughout the city, grave levels of air and water pollution, and myriad other problems, Rio de Janeiro is still widely recognized as one of the world’s more beautiful urban centres.</h2>

    <img src="https://ratisoaks.github.io/CSE20-034/arki.jpg" class="pigcha" width="700px" height="300px">UNESCO has named Rio as its first World Capital of Architecture for 2020. The forum will see year-long programs that examine worldwide issues through urban planning, culture, and architecture. One could easily visit Rio for building sightseeing alone. Highlights include: the pseudo-extraterrestrial Museum of Contemporary Art in Niterói, designed by the late Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (the striking modernist building also served as the stage for Louis Vuitton’s Resort 2017 show)
